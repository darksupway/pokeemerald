# Description
This is my version of a completionist Pokémon Emerald with some quality of life features.  
The focus of this decompilation is the possibility to catch every Pokémon without another game. 

# Changes
- added small side routes and caves with version exclusive Pokémon from Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire
- added new cave in the Battle Frontier for legendary Pokémon and other missing Pokémon from other generations (not all)
- Altering cave implementation (different wildsets with the last missing Pokémon from other Gens)
- Battle Frontier has new NPC (needed for completion, Battle Frontier cave and Altering Cave)
- the Deep Sea Item item not picked in the story can be found
- some fixes from the pokeemerald wiki and my own
- quality of life changes:
  - increased max money ([wiki](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Increase-money-limit))
  - repel renewal question ([wiki](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Prompt-for-reusing-Repels))
  - berry seller in flower shop after hall of fame
  - script that checks PC boxes for mirage island Pokémon
  - combined [L-/R-registered items](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10134388&postcount=56) and [2-in-1 Bike (Alterntive Take)](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10217718&postcount=172)  
  (2-in-1 Bike used R-Button to change modi, changed to L+R)
  - [Bag sorting](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10167488&postcount=84)
  - [Soot Sack Ash Quantity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10222284&postcount=178)
